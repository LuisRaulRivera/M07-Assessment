    "# ---------------------------------------------\n",
    "# You may need additional helper functions both in and out of the classes, add functions as you need to.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# No one function should be more then 50 lines of code, if you need more then 50 lines of code\n",
    "# excluding comments, break the function into multiple functions.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# You can store your raw menu text, and other blocks of texts as raw text files \n",
    "# and use placeholder values with the format option.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# In the file test.txt is \"My name is {fname}, I'm {age}\"\n",
    "# Then you later can read the file into a string \"filetxt\"\n",
    "# and substitute the placeholders \n",
    "# for example: filetxt.format(fname = \"John\", age = 36)\n",
