# M07-Assessment

This assessment required us to scrape names and dates for holidays for the years 2020-2024. The website used was: https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/.
We also needed to import a JSON file with holidays in there along with their dates. Ultimately, we created a menu interface that allows you to add, remove, and save holidays.
You are also able to view the holidays. Whatever you do in the menu, meaning your whole list of holidays, is saved in a new JSON file. Any changes you make to your list will be made in this new JSON file.
